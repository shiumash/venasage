# Venasage 🫀

## Overview

Venasage is an AI chatbot that provides clear, reliable answers to cardiovascular health questions. It combines trusted medical sources with smart retrieval technology, helping users make informed decisions with accurate, up-to-date information.

> Fun Fact: The name comes from *vena* the Latin word for 'vein' + *sage*, wise one'. Nifty huh?


## 🚀 Key Features

- **Intelligent Medical Information Retrieval**: Sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for precise, context-aware responses
- **Semantic Search Optimization**: Leveraging advanced embedding technologies for accurate, relevant information extraction
- **Reduced Hallucination**: Rigorous approach to minimizing AI-generated misinformation

## 💡 Inspiration & Approach

I was inspired Callum MacLeod's insightful Medium article ["Implementing RAG in LangChain with Chroma: A Step-by-Step Guide"](https://medium.com/@callumjmac/implementing-rag-in-langchain-with-chroma-a-step-by-step-guide-16fc21815339). My take will be tailored specifically to cardiovascular health information retrieval. Drawing from the foundational RAG concepts, our approach diverges by:

- Specializing in cardiovascular domain-specific knowledge
- Implementing custom preprocessing for medical text
- Developing with updated Langchain v0.3 modules.
- Incorporating more open-source tools.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### Embedding & Semantic Search
- **Embedding Model**: Hugging Face `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB for efficient semantic retrieval
- **Language Model**: Fine-tuned Llama 3.2

### Data Processing Capabilities
- **HTML/XML Parsing**: Developed robust web scraping and parsing techniques
- **Text Preprocessing**: Advanced preprocessing and crawling scripts for medical text corpus

## 🧠 Technical Architecture

Venasage represents a sophisticated approach to medical information retrieval, integrating:

- Semantic embedding techniques
- Vector database optimization
- Advanced machine learning models
